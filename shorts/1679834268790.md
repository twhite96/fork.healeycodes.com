I got a shoutout in the Val Town [newsletter](https://blog.val.town/blog/val-town-newsletter-5)!

> The award for best Val Town user this month clearly goes to Andrew Healey (@healeycodes) for his tireless work trying to outwit our and Deno's sandboxing. He‚Äôs up to maybe 5 exploits so far. So hats off to Andrew for keeping us all secure üôè

Over the past few weeks, I've been poking at some JavaScript sandboxes (including Val Town's Deno runtime before it was released). My experience has confirmed something I already expected ‚Äì which is that you need to sandbox "from the outside" or there will be obvious exploits.

Some examples of sandboxing from the inside:
- [vm2](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2) ([see some of the past breakouts](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/issues/338))
- Running user code in an isolated WebWorker but relying on `fetch` being hidden e.g. so you can limit the amount/type of network access. You can do `fetch = fetchWrapper` but people will still find a way to access the original.

Some examples of sandboxing from the outside:
- V8 isolates
- Running code in a AWS Lambda (and controlling access to the Lambda, and not caring if hostile code accesses the runtime environment you've created)
- Or using the [software that powers AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/firecracker-lightweight-virtualization-for-serverless-computing/) (Firecracker).
