Playing chess via voice commands.

I'm often pacing around the room while holding my new baby â€“ putting him to sleep, soothing him, burping him. I've also been playing more chess lately.

I hacked together a script to play lichess games via voice commands (so I could put my laptop on top of my wardrobe while holding my almost-asleep baby). The results were okay, I got it to play some moves for me, but it wasn't very reliable (~40% chance I'd need to repeat myself). So I put it aside for now.

Getting a voice recognizer to parse standard notation ("e2e4") seems harder than getting it to parse normal speech (like nouns, verbs, etc). I used [Whisper](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/) via `speech_recognition`, and `pyautogui` to handle clicking.

As you can see below, I tried some manual parsing to help with the accuracy. It would work better if I used more distinct words for the squares rather than standard notation but I wanted to use standard notation.

```python
import pyautogui
import speech_recognition

r = speech_recognition.Recognizer()

# lichess.org full screen, 14in MacBook Pro
top_left = [472, 217]
bot_right = [991, 738]

# calculate rows
x_space = (bot_right[0] - top_left[0]) / 7
x_rows = [top_left[0] + (x_space * i) for i in range(0, 8)]
y_space = (top_left[1] - bot_right[1]) / 7
y_rows = [top_left[1] - (y_space * i) for i in range(0, 8)]


# e.g "A1" -> (472.0, 217.0)
def position_to_xy(pos: str):
    letters = list("HGFEDCBA")
    numbers = list("12345678")

    letter, number = pos[0], pos[1]
    xy = (
        x_rows[letters.index(letter)],
        y_rows[numbers.index(number)],
    )
    return xy


while True:
    with speech_recognition.Microphone() as source:
        print("waiting..")
        voice = r.listen(source)
        command = r.recognize_whisper(voice)
        print(f"got command: {command}")

        # examples: "E2, E4.", "E2 E4"
        trimmed = command.upper().strip().replace(".", " ").replace(",", " ")
        positions = trimmed.split()

        if len(positions) != 2 or len(positions[0]) != 2 or len(positions[1]) != 2:
            print(f"warn: didn't get a valid position, got: {positions}")
            continue

        from_square = position_to_xy(positions[0])
        to_square = position_to_xy(positions[1])

        print(f"moving {positions[0]} -> {positions[1]}")
        pyautogui.moveTo(from_square[0], from_square[1])
        pyautogui.click()
        pyautogui.moveTo(to_square[0], to_square[1])
        pyautogui.click()
```
