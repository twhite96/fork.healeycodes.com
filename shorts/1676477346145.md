The amount of joy I get from making tiny changes to this website is _unreasonable_ high.

I am reflecting on this after adding some border radius to all code blocks in [b1dd2af8](https://github.com/healeycodes/healeycodes.com/commit/b1dd2af8f219b61a93d8b6032f94e691799ef6bf).

I also made it easy to start writing a note (like the one you're reading). All I have to do is run `node createNode.js` in the root directory of this repository.

```js
// Creates a note in ./notes/ with the schema `${TIMESTAMP}.md`

const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path')
const notesDir = './notes'

if (!fs.existsSync(notesDir)) {
    fs.mkdirSync(notesDir);
}
const filepath = path.join(notesDir, `${Date.now()}.md`)
fs.writeFileSync(filepath, '')

// This can be cmd+clicked from VS Code's terminal to open/edit it!
console.log(filepath)
```

In comparison, my flow for adding a new blog post is fraught with friction.

- Write the blog in Notion
- Get feedback from friends who add Notion comments
- Export from Notion to markdown
- Create an empty markdown file in `./posts/`
- Copy frontmatter from an existing post (and edit the front matter)
- Paste in the exported post from Notion (minus the title)
- Fix apostrophes and quote marks to be the ASCII variants (`'` and `"`)
- Fix any weird markdown differences (sometimes I need to do stuff like add or delete empty lines)
- Manually move the images from the exported dump to: `public/posts/$postId/$imageName.png`
- Update the image markdown links in the created markdown file I just created

Most of the steps after _Export to markdown_ could be automated by a script that consumes an exported Notion dump. Seeing that I've used this tedious blog creation flow for more than a year, it's probably worth writing a quick script to automate it!
